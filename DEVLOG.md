- Approve completion → user balance increases immediately.
- Reject withdrawal → ledger reversal credit appears in user's ledger.

---

## ✅ Stage 9 — Fraud Detection & Audit
**Pushed:** commit `a65b64b`
**Date:** 2026-07-11

- `src/app/admin/fraud/page.tsx` — open flags table with severity filter; critical/high summary cards; one-click resolve
- `src/app/admin/audit-logs/page.tsx` — 50-per-page immutable log with action search, colour-coded action badges, mono font for IDs
- `src/app/api/admin/fraud/route.ts` — GET open flags filtered by severity; PATCH resolve
- `src/app/api/admin/audit-logs/route.ts` — GET paginated, filterable by actor and action

### Verify
- Resolve a fraud flag → it disappears from the list; count decrements.
- Audit log is read-only — no edit or delete is possible (DB trigger enforces this).

---

## ✅ Stage 10 — Ledger Explorer & Reports (Admin)
**Pushed:** commit `ea92942`
**Date:** 2026-07-11

### Built
- `src/app/admin/ledger/page.tsx` — full cross-user ledger; filter by user ID, ref type, date range; 50/page; colour-coded credit/debit
- `src/app/admin/reports/page.tsx` — period toggle (7d/30d/90d); signups+completions area chart; daily credits bar chart; top-tasks ranked bar; withdrawal volume breakdown
- `src/app/api/admin/ledger/route.ts` — paginated, filterable by user, ref_type, date range
- `src/app/api/admin/reports/route.ts` — aggregated daily stats, top tasks, withdrawal volume

### Verify
- Switch period → charts reload with correct date range.
- Filter ledger by user ID → only that user's entries appear.
- Top tasks list is sorted by completion count descending.

---

## ✅ Stage 11 — Public Pages
**Pushed:** commit `(pending)`
**Date:** 2026-07-11

### Built
- `src/components/layout/PublicHeader.tsx` — sticky nav, mobile drawer, CTA buttons
- `src/components/layout/Footer.tsx` — 3-column links, tagline, year
- `src/app/page.tsx` — hero, stats bar, how-it-works (4 steps), features, sample tasks grid, testimonials, CTA
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` — mission, values (3 cards), stat tiles
- `src/app/faq/page.tsx` — 11 Q&A cards covering earning, withdrawals, referrals, safety
- `src/app/contact/page.tsx` — contact form (name, email, topic select, message), simulated submit

### Verify
- Landing page renders at `/`; "Get Started Free" navigates to `/register`.
- Mobile nav opens/closes correctly at small viewports.
- Contact form shows success state after submission.

---

## ✅ Stage 12 — Cron Jobs
**Pushed:** 2026-07-11

### Built
- `src/app/api/cron/process-tasks/route.ts` — closes expired tasks (status: active/paused → completed); authenticated by `x-cron-secret` header; writes audit log entry on each run
- `.github/workflows/cron.yml` — GitHub Actions schedule (hourly at :00); uses `APP_URL` + `CRON_SECRET` repo secrets; supports manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger

### Verify
- Trigger manually via Actions → Run workflow → response 200.
- Expired task (expires_at < now, status = active) → status becomes `completed` after cron runs.
- Audit log records `cron.process_expired_tasks` action with count and task IDs.
- Missing or wrong `CRON_SECRET` header → 401 response.

---

## ✅ Stage 13 — Production Hardening
**Pushed:** 2026-07-11

### Built
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` — fixed implicit `any` on `cookiesToSet` parameter (Vercel TS build error)
- `src/middleware.ts` — same fix; both `createServerClient` call sites now fully typed
- `src/app/error.tsx` — error boundary page with retry + back-to-dashboard actions; logs `error.digest`
- `src/app/not-found.tsx` — 404 page with home + dashboard navigation
- `vercel.json` — security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, XSS, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) + permanent redirects (`/login` → `/sign-in`, `/signup` → `/register`)
- `README.md` — full setup guide: Supabase migrations, env vars table, local dev, Vercel deployment, cron secrets, project structure, architecture decisions
- `package.json` — Next.js upgraded `15.3.4` → `15.5.20` (patches CVE-2025-66478); `eslint-config-next` bumped to match
- **18 loading skeletons** — `loading.tsx` for every async page:
  - Dashboard: overview, tasks, my-tasks, earnings, withdrawal, referral, notifications, profile, security
  - Admin: overview, users, tasks, approvals, withdrawals, fraud, audit-logs, ledger, reports

### Verify
- Vercel build completes with no TypeScript errors.
- Slow network: navigating to any dashboard or admin page shows a skeleton, not a blank screen.
- `/login` redirects to `/sign-in` (301).
- `curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app` — response includes `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.
- Non-existent route → renders `not-found.tsx` (404 page).
- Runtime error in a page → renders `error.tsx` with retry button.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Tier System Expansion
**Pushed:** commit `a3f9c61` (approx)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- `supabase/migrations/20260716_tier_task_completions.sql` — adds `min_completions` column to `tiers` table (**must be run manually in Supabase SQL editor**)
- `src/lib/tiers.ts` — `pickTierForUser()` uses OR logic: referral threshold OR task-completion threshold promotes a user. `recalcUserTier()` fetches both referral and completion counts. `getUserTierStatus()` now returns `totalCompletions`.
- `src/app/api/tasks/[id]/complete/route.ts` + `src/app/api/admin/approvals/route.ts` — both call `recalcUserTier()` after a task is approved, so tiers advance immediately on completion.
- `src/app/api/admin/tiers/[id]/route.ts` — accepts `min_completions` in the update schema.
- `src/app/admin/tiers/page.tsx` — admin UI shows "Min. Tasks Completed to Unlock" field alongside the existing referral threshold.
- `src/app/dashboard/referral/page.tsx` — dual progress bars: one for referrals, one for task completions toward next tier.

### Verify
- Set `min_completions = 5` on a tier → user who completes 5 tasks (without any referrals) advances to that tier.
- Admin tiers page saves `min_completions` without error.
- Referral page progress bars both update correctly.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Tier Badge Throughout Dashboard
**Pushed:** commit (included above)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` — fetches `getUserTierStatus()` server-side, passes `currentTier` to the header on every page load.
- `src/components/layout/DashboardHeader.tsx` — colour-coded tier badge pill next to balance (Bronze=amber, Silver=slate, Gold=yellow, Platinum=cyan, Diamond=blue, Elite=purple); links to referral page.
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — clickable tier card between stats grid and transactions: badge, perks list, today's task count vs. limit, mini dual progress bars.
- `src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` — tier badge alongside role and KYC badges in avatar card.

### Verify
- Log in as Bronze user → amber "Bronze" pill visible in header and profile card.
- Complete tasks to advance tier → pill updates on next load.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Pending Verification State
**Pushed:** commit (included above)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- `src/app/api/verification/request/route.ts` — added `GET` (returns user's active pending request) and `DELETE` (cancels it by marking it rejected with note "Cancelled by user").
- `src/app/dashboard/verify/page.tsx` — on load, checks for a pending request in parallel with page data. If pending: shows amber card with submitted reference, a blue "same reference can't be reused" warning, and a cancel button. Fresh form also shows the duplicate-reference note inline.

### Verify
- Submit a verification request → page immediately shows the pending state card.
- Click cancel → status flips to rejected; page returns to the fresh form.
- Attempting a second request with the same reference → inline warning shown.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Referral System Overhaul
**Pushed:** commit `b430c78`
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- **URL fix** — `src/app/api/referrals/route.ts` builds referral URL from request host headers (`x-forwarded-host` / `host`) with `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` as fallback only. Links work without the env var.
- **Live code validation** — new `GET /api/referrals/validate?code=XXX` (public, no auth). Register form debounces 500 ms then shows green ✓ (valid), red ✗ (invalid), or spinner; invalid codes highlight the input border and block submission; code is uppercased before submission.
- **Dynamic bonus amounts** — `/api/referrals` now returns `referral_bonus_kobo` and `signup_bonus_kobo` from constants. Referral page header, "How It Works" steps, and share copy all use live values — no hardcoded ₦500/₦200.
- **KYC gate on referral bonus** — `creditReferralBonus()` checks `fee_enabled`; if verification is on, the referred user must have `kyc_verified = true` before ₦ is released. Admin KYC approval route now calls `creditReferralBonus()` after flipping `kyc_verified`, covering users who completed a task before getting verified (both paths covered, no double-credit).
- **Referral table status** — three clear states: "Awaiting activation" (not yet KYC-verified), "Awaiting first task" (verified, no completion yet), "Credited" (bonus paid).

### Verify
- Register with a referral code → green tick confirms code before submission.
- Register with a fake code → red X blocks form submission.
- With verification on: referred user completes task but isn't verified → referrer gets no bonus yet → admin approves KYC → bonus lands immediately.
- With verification off: bonus lands on first task completion as before.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Security & Performance Hardening (Round 1)
**Pushed:** commit `7b8b6d3`
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- **Task-owner guard** — `src/app/api/tasks/[id]/complete/route.ts`: added `task.created_by === user.id → 403`. Prevents advertisers completing their own tasks.
- **Atomic withdrawal debit** — `src/app/api/withdrawals/route.ts` now calls `safe_withdrawal_debit()` Postgres RPC instead of the old `assertSufficientBalance → appendLedger` sequence. The RPC holds a per-user advisory lock, reads the balance, and writes the debit inside one transaction — eliminates the overdraft race condition under concurrent requests.
- **Missing DB indexes** (`supabase/migrations/20260713_perf_and_safety.sql`):
  - `task_completions(user_id, status, created_at DESC)` — used by daily limit check and tier calc on every task attempt; previously a full scan.
  - `platform_settings(key)` — used by `getVerificationSettings` + `getAdvertiserSettings` on every layout load; previously a full scan.
  - `users(tier)` — tier-based filtering in admin and tier logic.
- **Unique partial index** — `withdrawals(user_id) WHERE status IN ('pending','under_review')` — DB-enforced single active withdrawal per user; concurrent requests that both slip past the app-level check will hit a `23505` constraint violation.
- **Next.js caching** — `getAllTiers()` and `getVerificationSettings()` wrapped with `unstable_cache` (5-minute TTL). Both were hitting the DB on every single request from every user.

### Verify
- Run `supabase/migrations/20260713_perf_and_safety.sql` in Supabase SQL editor.
- Task created by User A → User A tries to complete it → 403 "cannot complete your own task".
- Two simultaneous withdrawal requests → only one succeeds; no ledger overdraft.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Materialized Balance Column
**Pushed:** commit `9d7ab13`
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- `supabase/migrations/20260713_materialized_balance.sql`:
  - Adds `users.balance_kobo BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` — materialized running total.
  - Backfills from existing ledger data (one-time `UPDATE ... SET balance_kobo = SUM(delta)`), running before the trigger is created to avoid double-counting.
  - `sync_user_balance()` trigger fires `AFTER INSERT ON ledger`, incrementing `balance_kobo` within the same transaction — can never drift from ledger.
  - Rewrites `get_user_balance(uuid)` from `SELECT SUM(delta) FROM ledger …` (O(n)) to `SELECT balance_kobo FROM users WHERE id = $1` (O(1)). All TypeScript callers unchanged.
  - Rewrites `safe_withdrawal_debit()` to use `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the user row instead of an advisory lock — serialises concurrent withdrawals per user, with the trigger keeping `balance_kobo` in sync automatically.
- `src/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` — removes N+1 `Promise.all` loop that called `get_user_balance` once per user. `balance_kobo` is now a plain column on the users row; the existing `SELECT *` already returns it.

### Verify
- Run `supabase/migrations/20260713_materialized_balance.sql` in Supabase SQL editor (**after** the perf_and_safety migration).
- After backfill: `SELECT id, balance_kobo FROM users LIMIT 10` matches `SELECT user_id, SUM(delta) FROM ledger GROUP BY user_id LIMIT 10`.
- Complete a task → `users.balance_kobo` updates immediately.
- Admin users list loads in one query — no per-row RPC calls in server logs.

## ✅ Post-launch — Bank Verification Provider Switch (RapidAPI, then Flutterwave)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- Initially moved bank account verification from Paystack to a RapidAPI provider ("Nigeria Bank Account validation"). In production this provider proved unreliable — intermittent `504` timeouts and `404 Endpoint '/login' does not exist` errors, reproducible even against the provider's own example request. Removed it entirely.
- `src/lib/flutterwave.ts` — new provider for bank verification, built against Flutterwave's **v4 API**: `fetchBanks()` (`GET /banks?country=NG`) and `resolveAccount()` (`POST /banks/account-resolve`). v4 authenticates via OAuth2 client-credentials (`FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_ID` + `FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_SECRET` exchanged for a short-lived bearer token), not a static secret key — the access token is cached in memory and refreshed on expiry.
- Moved `src/app/api/paystack/{banks,resolve}` → `src/app/api/bank-verification/{banks,resolve}`, now backed by `flutterwave.ts`.
- `src/app/api/withdrawals/accounts/route.ts` — `resolveAccount` import switched from `@/lib/paystack` to `@/lib/flutterwave`.
- `src/app/dashboard/withdrawal/page.tsx` — bank list + account resolution calls updated to the new `/api/bank-verification/*` routes.
- `.env.example` / `README.md` — documented `FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_ID` / `FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `FLUTTERWAVE_ENV`; clarified `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` is now only used for the withdrawal verification fee and advertiser payments.
- `src/lib/paystack.ts` left untouched — kept as-is for those two payment flows and as a future fallback/alternate verification provider.

### Verify
- Add a bank account on `/dashboard/withdrawal` → account name resolves via Flutterwave, not Paystack or RapidAPI.
- `GET /api/bank-verification/banks` returns Flutterwave's live NG bank list.
- Withdrawal verification-fee flow (`/api/verification/paystack`) and advertiser payments (`/api/advertiser/paystack`) still work unchanged — they never touched account verification.

---

## ✅ Post-launch — Dropped Flutterwave, Reinstated Paystack for Bank Verification
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Built
- Removed `src/lib/flutterwave.ts` entirely — the OAuth2 client-credentials flow, in-memory bearer token cache, and Flutterwave-specific envelope parsing are gone.
- `src/app/api/bank-verification/{banks,resolve}/route.ts` and `src/app/api/withdrawals/accounts/route.ts` — `resolveAccount`/`fetchBanks` imports switched back to `@/lib/paystack` (unchanged since Stage 4; never removed).
- Kept the `/api/bank-verification/*` route paths as-is (no frontend changes needed) rather than reverting to the older `/api/paystack/*` paths — `src/app/dashboard/withdrawal/page.tsx` already calls these and needs no edits.
- `src/types/index.ts` — removed the unused `BankOption` type that existed only for the Flutterwave bank list shape; `PaystackBank`/`PaystackResolveResponse` (already in place) cover the full bank-verification surface again.
- `.env.example` / `README.md` — removed all `FLUTTERWAVE_*` documentation; `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` is now documented as the single provider for bank list, account resolution, the withdrawal verification fee, and advertiser payments.

### Why
- Flutterwave's v4 API added OAuth2 token-exchange complexity and a second provider to operate, without resolving anything Paystack couldn't already do reliably for bank verification. Paystack was never actually broken — only the abandoned RapidAPI provider was. Consolidating back onto one payments provider (Paystack) reduces the number of external dependencies, secrets, and failure modes to reason about.

### Verify
- Add a bank account on `/dashboard/withdrawal` → account name resolves via Paystack (`GET/POST https://api.paystack.co/bank/...`), not Flutterwave.
- `GET /api/bank-verification/banks` returns Paystack's cached (1hr) NG bank list.
- `FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_ID` / `FLUTTERWAVE_CLIENT_SECRET` / `FLUTTERWAVE_ENV` are no longer referenced anywhere in the codebase.
- Withdrawal verification-fee flow (`/api/verification/paystack`) and advertiser payments (`/api/advertiser/paystack`) continue to work unchanged.

---

## ✅ Security fix — Paystack reference replay in both payment routes
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Found
While reviewing `/api/verification/paystack` and `/api/advertiser/paystack` ahead of switching to live Paystack keys: both routes verified a `reference` against Paystack's `/transaction/verify/:reference` endpoint and, on `status: "success"`, immediately marked something paid/verified — but neither route recorded that the reference had been consumed. A Paystack reference stays `"success"` forever once a real transaction completes, so:
- `verification/paystack` — any authenticated user submitting a reference that *anyone* had ever paid successfully (their own past payment, a friend's, one scraped from a receipt) got `kyc_verified = true` for free, repeatably.
- `advertiser/paystack` — this route has no auth by design (advertiser leads are unauthenticated). A single real payment's reference could be replayed across unlimited `submission_id`s, marking every one of them `"paid"`.

### Built
- `supabase/migrations/20260717_paystack_reference_dedup.sql`:
  - `idx_task_submissions_payment_reference_unique` — partial unique index on `task_submissions.payment_reference WHERE payment_reference IS NOT NULL` (unpaid rows stay NULL and unaffected).
  - `paystack_verification_references` table (`reference` PK, `user_id`, `created_at`) — `kyc_verified` is a bare boolean with nowhere to record which reference paid for it, so verification dedup needed its own table rather than a column constraint. RLS enabled, service-role-only (same pattern as `phone_verification_codes`).
- `src/app/api/verification/paystack/route.ts` — inserts into `paystack_verification_references` *before* flipping `kyc_verified`; a `23505` conflict (reference already claimed) returns `409` instead of re-verifying.
- `src/app/api/advertiser/paystack/route.ts` — checks for an existing row with the same `payment_reference` before updating, plus a `23505` catch on the update itself as a race-condition backstop; both paths return `409` with "This payment reference has already been used."

### Verify
- Submit the same successful reference twice to `/api/verification/paystack` (two different sessions, or the same session twice) → second call returns `409`, first call's `kyc_verified` change stands.
- Submit the same reference for two different `submission_id`s to `/api/advertiser/paystack` → second call returns `409`; only the first submission is marked `"paid"`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean with no new type errors.

## ✅ Fix — admin verification-settings changes not applying (stale 5-minute cache)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Found
Reported: switching the withdrawal-verification payment method to "Paystack" in Admin Settings kept showing the Bank Transfer flow on `/dashboard/verify`. `getVerificationSettings()` (`src/lib/verification.ts`) wraps its Supabase read in `unstable_cache(..., { revalidate: 300, tags: ["verification-settings"] })`, but `PATCH /api/admin/settings` only upserted `platform_settings` rows — it never called `revalidateTag("verification-settings")`. Every read (including `/api/settings/verification`, which `/dashboard/verify` calls) kept serving the pre-change cached value for up to 5 minutes after a save.

### Built
- `src/app/api/admin/settings/route.ts` — after the upsert loop, calls `revalidateTag("verification-settings")` whenever the write touched any of the keys `getVerificationSettings()` reads (`verification_fee_enabled`, `verification_fee_amount`, `verification_payment_method`, `bank_transfer_name`, `bank_transfer_number`, `bank_transfer_bank`, `phone_verification_enabled`, `min_withdrawal_kobo`).
- Confirmed `getAdvertiserSettings()` / `getAdsSettings()` (`src/lib/advertiser.ts`) hit Supabase directly on every call with no caching layer — they were never affected by this bug, no changes needed there.

### Verify
- Change `verification_payment_method` in Admin Settings → reload `/dashboard/verify` immediately → Paystack flow shows right away, no 5-minute wait.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean.

## ✅ Fix — "Paystack not loaded" error on withdrawal-verification page
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Found
Reported: after the fee card correctly switched to "Pay with Paystack", tapping the button sometimes showed "Paystack not loaded. Refresh and try again." The inline SDK was mounted as a raw JSX `<script src="https://js.paystack.co/v1/inline.js" />`, added to the DOM only after `settings` loaded (client-side, post-hydration). There was no load/error signal — `handlePaystackPayment` just checked `window.PaystackPop` once at click time, so a click before the script finished fetching (slow network, or a script/ad blocker holding it up) always failed, with no way to tell the two cases apart or retry without a full reload.

### Built
- `src/app/dashboard/verify/page.tsx` — swapped the raw `<script>` tag for `next/script`'s `<Script strategy="afterInteractive">`, with `onReady`/`onError` driving a `paystackScriptStatus` state (`"loading" | "ready" | "error"`).
- Pay button now disables and shows "Loading Paystack…" until the SDK actually fires `onReady`, instead of racing the click.
- On `onError` (blocked/failed request), shows an inline message telling the user to check their connection or disable ad/script blockers for the site, with a one-tap "reload the page" retry — no more generic unexplained failure.

### Verify
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean (fresh `npm install`, 493 packages, no errors).
- Manually confirmed the button stays disabled during the loading window and flips to the error state (with retry) when `onError` fires; can't fully simulate a live blocked-script network condition from this environment, but the state machine covers both the load-race and outright load-failure cases that produced the original bug.

## ✅ Fix — "Loading Paystack…" spinner never resolves (stuck indefinitely)
**Date:** 2026-07-13

### Found
Reported: after the previous fix, the Pay button just showed "Loading Paystack…" forever instead of becoming clickable or showing an error. Some blockers/network conditions stall the `<script src="https://js.paystack.co/v1/inline.js">` request without ever firing `next/script`'s `onLoad` *or* `onError` callback (e.g. a request that never resolves, or is silently dropped) — so `paystackScriptStatus` stayed stuck on `"loading"` with no path forward.

### Built
- `src/app/dashboard/verify/page.tsx` — added a second, independent readiness check: while the Paystack card is showing and status is still `"loading"`, poll every 300ms for `window.PaystackPop` to appear (in case the script actually loaded but `onLoad` didn't fire for some reason), and give up after 10s, flipping to the existing `"error"` state either way. This guarantees the UI always reaches a definite ready/error state instead of spinning forever, regardless of how the script fails.

### Verify
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean (fresh `npm install`, no errors).
- Reasoned through the three cases: (1) script loads fine → `onReady` fires immediately, poll never needed; (2) script blocked with a fired error event → existing `onError` path handles it well before the 10s timeout; (3) script silently stalls with no event → poll's 10s timeout now guarantees a transition out of "loading" either way.
